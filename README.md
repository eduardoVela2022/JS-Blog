# The JavaScript Blog

## Description

The JavaScript Blog is a simple blog website were you can post about JavaScript topics, and comment on the posts of others. The reason I built this project was to practice the MVC architecture, since the project is divided into models, views and controllers. The models are the ones that control the shape of the data the web application handles, the views how the user interface of the application will look like, the controllers the routes and API routes that are available. During the development of this project, I learned how the different parts of a full stack application interact with each other, and that each part is essential for it to work properly, since if the models, views or controllers of the application are flawed, the flawed components will affect the functionality of other components an so on.
